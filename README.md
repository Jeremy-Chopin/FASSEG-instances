# FASSEG-instances
This directory contains a semantic segmentation proposal for the FASSEG human face database (https://github.com/massimomauro/FASSEG-repository).

## Test

This segmentation proposes to differentiate between certain elements of the face such as the eyes (e.g. right eye - left eye) based on the Frontal 01 dataset from the initial FASSEG dataset.
